								<h1 style="font-size: 2rem; line-height: 1.2;">Census Data Analysis: Demographic Insights for Future Investments and Local Government Facility Planning</h1>
							</header>

							<section>
								<p><strong>Project Overview:</strong><br />
									This report details the analysis of a mock census dataset from a small town, aimed at providing insights to the Local Government for future investments and decisions regarding the development of an unoccupied plot of land. The dataset includes 11 variables and 8,485 observations representing the town’s population, and covers a range of demographic, economic, and social factors.
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h2>Data Overview and Cleaning</h2>
								<p>The dataset consists of both numeric and categorical data, with notable fields such as "Age," "Marital Status," "Religion," "Occupation," and "Infirmity." Approximately 4.5% of the data had missing values, mainly in the "Marital Status" and "Religion" fields. To prepare the dataset for analysis, several data cleaning procedures were carried out:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Missing data imputation:</strong> Logical assumptions were applied to fill in missing entries, e.g., missing "Age" values were replaced with the average age for similar occupations.</li>
									<li><strong>Data consistency:</strong> Spelling mistakes like "Neice" were corrected to "Niece," and inconsistent categorical values (e.g., "M" and "f" in gender) were standardized.</li>
									<li><strong>Handling blanks and inconsistencies:</strong> Inconsistent or blank entries in fields like "Marital Status" and "Religion" were imputed using surrounding data points, such as age and occupation.</li>
								</ul>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
								<p>A series of exploratory data analyses were performed to gain insights into the population’s structure and identify key trends:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Age distribution:</strong> The age pyramid showed a gender-balanced population, with the largest group being young adults (15-39 years). The population's age structure suggested slight growth, driven by higher birth rates than death rates.</li>
									<li><strong>Commuting patterns:</strong> A significant portion of the population (75%) is involved in commuting, including university students and employed individuals. This insight highlighted the potential need for a train station to alleviate road congestion.</li>
									<li><strong>Occupation and unemployment:</strong> Occupation categories were analyzed, showing a predominant employed population, with noticeable commuting. The analysis also highlighted age-related unemployment trends, particularly among people aged 30-45 years.</li>
									<li><strong>Marital and divorce trends:</strong> A higher rate of divorce, especially among females in middle age, was noted, influencing potential housing needs.</li>
									<li><strong>Household size:</strong> A large proportion of households (66%) consisted of 3 or fewer members, suggesting that existing housing may be underutilized.</li>
									<li><strong>Health and infirmities:</strong> Less than 1% of the population reported infirmities, suggesting a relatively healthy town.</li>
									<li><strong>Religious affiliations:</strong> The distribution of religious affiliations was explored to determine demand for additional places of worship or other religious buildings.</li>
								</ul>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h2>Key Findings</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Population growth:</strong> The town’s population is growing slightly, with a balanced gender ratio and a significant proportion of young adults.</li>
									<li><strong>High commuting rate:</strong> A large proportion (75%) of residents are commuters, primarily university students and employed individuals, indicating a demand for a train station.</li>
									<li><strong>Household occupancy:</strong> With small household sizes, the demand for high-density housing is limited, but targeted development may be needed.</li>
									<li><strong>Marriage and divorce trends:</strong> The high divorce rate, especially among females, may influence housing needs and social services.</li>
									<li><strong>Aging population:</strong> Although the infirmity rate is low, the aging population may require future investments in healthcare and elderly care facilities.</li>
								</ul>
							</section>

							<section class="recommendations">
								<h2>Recommendations</h2>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Train Station:</strong> Given the high commuting rate, building a train station is recommended to improve transportation and alleviate road congestion.</li>
									<li><strong>Employment and Training Programs:</strong> Targeted employment training should be developed, especially for individuals in the 30-45 age group who are more likely to experience unemployment.</li>
									<li><strong>Infrastructure Investment:</strong> While there is no immediate need for large-scale housing development, investment in infrastructure, such as roads and public transport, is recommended to accommodate a growing commuter population.</li>
									<li><strong>Elderly Care Facilities:</strong> An investment in elderly care facilities is suggested, considering the potential for an aging population in the future.</li>
								</ol>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<p>The project utilized statistical methods and visualizations to explore trends in the data, offering valuable insights for local government planning. The town’s demographic and economic profile indicates that infrastructure development, particularly in transportation and services for the aging population, should be prioritized. Investments in housing are not immediately necessary, but targeted developments should be considered based on the needs of the population.</p>
								<p>The recommendations are grounded in the data, providing actionable insights to support informed decision-making for the town's future development and public services.</p>
